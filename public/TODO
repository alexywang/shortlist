Short Term:
1. findMatchingEntries() is too unreliable, needs update or switch to Facebook API first 
2. Move printed restaurnt information into Google Maps Markers


Long Term:
1. Update to server-side scripting
2. Auto-Complete Restaurant Names for easier searching
3. Choose between current location and enter location when setting home
